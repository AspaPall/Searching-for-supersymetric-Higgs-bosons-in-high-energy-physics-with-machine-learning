# Searching-for-supersymetric-Higgs-bosons-in-high-energy-physics-with-machine-learning
This assignment is about the implementation of some machine learning techniques for choosing the events in LHC that are connected to supersymetry Higgs bosons. 
The exercise is based on the article **Searching for exotic particles in high-energy physics with deep learning** by P. Baldi, P. Sadowski and D. Whiteson. The data are separated in classification, low level and high level quantities.
Two supervised machine learning methods where used, KNN classification, and Random Forest. Additionally, an analysis has been done with an artificial neural network technique that uses the tensorflow library. All the three methods were implement separately for low and high quantities in a Jupiter Notebook.
